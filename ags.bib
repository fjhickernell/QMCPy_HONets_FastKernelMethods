abstract = {Gradient boosted trees (GBTs) are ubiquitous models used by researchers, machine learning (ML) practitioners, and data scientists because of their robust performance, interpretable behavior, and ease-of-use. One critical challenge in training GBTs is the tuning of their hyperparameters. In practice, selecting these hyperparameters is often done manually. Recently, the ML community has advocated for tuning hyperparameters through black-box optimization and developed state-of-the-art systems to do so. However, applying such systems to tune GBTs suffers from two drawbacks. First, these systems are not model-aware, rather they are designed to apply to a generic model; this leaves significant optimization performance on the table. Second, using these systems requires domain knowledge such as the choice of hyperparameter search space, which is an antithesis to the automatic experimentation that black-box optimization aims to provide. In this paper, we present SigOpt Mulch, a model-aware hyperparameter tuning system specifically designed for automated tuning of GBTs that provides two improvements over existing systems. First, Mulch leverages powerful techniques in metalearning and multifidelity optimization to perform model-aware hyperparameter optimization. Second, it automates the process of learning performant hyperparameters by making intelligent decisions about the optimization search space, thus reducing the need for user domain knowledge. These innovations allow Mulch to identify good GBT hyperparameters far more efficiently â€”and in a more seamless and user-friendly wayâ€” than existing black-box hyperparameter tuning systems.}

To illustrate our method we provide some numerical examples for neural networks.}

abstract = {Limiting the injection rate to restrict the pressure below a threshold at a critical location can be an important goal of simulations that model the subsurface pressure between injection and extraction wells. The pressure is approximated by the solution of Darcyâ€™s partial differential equation for a given permeability field. The subsurface permeability is modeled as a random field since it is known only up to statistical properties. This induces uncertainty in the computed pressure. Solving the partial differential equation for an ensemble of random permeability simulations enables estimating a probability distribution for the pressure at the critical location. These simulations are computationally expensive, and practitioners often need rapid online guidance for real-time pressure management. An ensemble of numerical partial differential equation solutions is used to construct a Gaussian process regression model that can quickly predict the pressure at the critical location as a function of the extraction rate and permeability realization. The Gaussian process surrogate analyzes the ensemble of numerical pressure solutions at the critical location as noisy observations of the true pressure solution, enabling robust inference using the conditional Gaussian process distribution. Our first novel contribution is to identify a sampling methodology for the random environment and matching kernel technology for which fitting the Gaussian process regression model scales as O(nlogn) instead of the typical O(n3) rate in the number of samples n used to fit the surrogate. The surrogate model allows almost instantaneous predictions for the pressure at the critical location as a function of the extraction rate and permeability realization. Our second contribution is a novel algorithm to calibrate the uncertainty in the surrogate model to the discrepancy between the true pressure solution of Darcyâ€™s equation and the numerical solution. Although our method is derived for building a surrogate for the solution of Darcyâ€™s equation with a random permeability field, the framework broadly applies to solutions of other partial differential equations with random coefficients.}

    abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers that will introduce a user-friendly, detailed, and modular Galactic Chemical Evolution Model, GalCEM, that tracks isotope masses as a function of time in a given galaxy. The list of tracked isotopes automatically adapts to the complete set provided by the input yields. The present iteration of GalCEM tracks 86 elements broken down into 451 isotopes. The prescription includes massive stars, low-to-intermediate-mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae as enrichment channels. We have developed a preprocessing tool that extracts multidimensional interpolation curves from the input yield tables. These interpolation curves improve the computation speeds of the full convolution integrals, which are computed for each isotope and for each enrichment channel. We map the integrand quantities onto consistent array grids in order to perform the numerical integration at each time step. The differential equation is solved with a fourth-order Rungeâ€“Kutta method. We constrain our analysis to the evolution of all light and intermediate elements from carbon to zinc, and lithium. Our results are consistent up to the extremely metal-poor regime with Galactic abundances. We provide tools to track the mass rate change of individual isotopes on a typical spiral galaxy with a final baryonic mass of 5 Ã— 1010  M âŠ™. Future iterations of the work will extend to the full periodic table by including the enrichment from neutron-capture channels as well as spatially dependent treatments of galaxy properties. GalCEM is publicly available at https://github.com/egjergo/GalCEM.}

  abstract = {We introduce a simple, rigorous, and unified framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), and for solving inverse problems (IPs) involving the identification of parameters in PDEs, using the framework of Gaussian processes. The proposed approach: (1) provides a natural generalization of collocation kernel methods to nonlinear PDEs and IPs; (2) has guaranteed convergence for a very general class of PDEs, and comes equipped with a path to compute error bounds for specific PDE approximations; (3) inherits the state-of-the-art computational complexity of linear solvers for dense kernel matrices. The main idea of our method is to approximate the solution of a given PDE as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of a Gaussian process conditioned on solving the PDE at a finite number of collocation points. Although this optimization problem is infinite-dimensional, it can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one by introducing additional variables corresponding to the values of the derivatives of the solution at collocation points; this generalizes the representer theorem arising in Gaussian process regression. The reduced optimization problem has the form of a quadratic objective function subject to nonlinear constraints; it is solved with a variant of the Gaussâ€“Newton method. The resulting algorithm (a) can be interpreted as solving successive linearizations of the nonlinear PDE, and (b) in practice is found to converge in a small number of iterations (2 to 10), for a wide range of PDEs. Most traditional approaches to IPs interleave parameter updates with numerical solution of the PDE; our algorithm solves for both parameter and PDE solution simultaneously. Experiments on nonlinear elliptic PDEs, Burgers' equation, a regularized Eikonal equation, and an IP for permeability identification in Darcy flow illustrate the efficacy and scope of our framework.}
